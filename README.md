A timeline that showcases your accomplishments in an easily-shareable way

## welcome!
This is a brand-spanking-new project. It's just me working on it for now with the help of a couple of wonderful advisors. 

I'm currently only accepting help from boss-level badasses who I know and like. If you're not quite ready to put yourself in that category but wanna join in, don't worry -- you can check back later! I might eventually let one or two enthusiastic junior engineers hop on board.

## ðŸš§ progress ðŸš§ 
Right now I'm working on the overall design / concept of the app. None of it is anywhere close to finished. If you must look (you really shouldn't), you can see the half-baked db design <a href="https://dbdesigner.page.link/BbUaAy574DscQMPf9" target="_blank">here.</a>
